This repository contains tutorial for using Seurat to run single cell RNA-Seq data analysis
1. Tutorial on running some basic routine analysis in R by using Seurat package
2. Data integration or batch effect correction for joint analysis of multiple scRNA-seq data sets
3. Cell type annotation label transfer given the reference data set

The dataset for this tutorial is obtained from the paper Organoid single-cell genomic atlas uncovers human-specific features of brain development [Kanton, S., Boyle, M. J., He, Z., Santel, M., Weigert, A., Sanch√≠s-Calleja, F., ... & Camp, J. G. (2019). Organoid single-cell genomic atlas uncovers human-specific features of brain development. Nature, 574(7778), 418-422.]
